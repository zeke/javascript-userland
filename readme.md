## Electron Universe

This is the Electron app I created as a slide deck for my talk about [Electron](https://electron.atom.io) at GitHub Universe 2016.

To run it locally, with animations and links and whatnot:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/zeke/electron-universe
cd electron-universe
npm install && npm start
```

or view the inanimate and non-hypertexty version at
[speakerdeck.com/zeke/electron-universe](https://speakerdeck.com/zeke/electron-universe).
